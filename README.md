# IoT Simulation Device Monitor

This project simulates the monitoring and control of various Internet of Things (IoT) devices like **smart lights**, **thermostats**, and **security cameras**. The application generates random data for the devices, allows users to interact with them, and logs attributes like power consumption, temperature, or motion detection over time.

## Project Overview

This project simulates an IoT environment, where users can monitor and control various devices through a console-based interface. The project includes several types of IoT devices:
- **Smart Light**: Can be turned ON/OFF and have adjustable brightness.
- **Thermostat**: Can set and read the current temperature.
- **Security Camera**: Can detect motion and record the status of its operation.

The user can interact with these devices by turning them on or off, adjusting their settings, and tracking their status over time.

3. Create a new branch
=> Create a new branch for your changes. It's recommended to use descriptive names for the branch, e.g., feature/turn-on-light.
```bash

git checkout -b feature/your-feature
```
4. Make changes
=> Now, make the changes you want to contribute. You can add new devices, update functionality, or improve documentation.
5. Commit your changes
=> Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:
```bash
git add .
```
```bash
git commit -m "Added new feature for controlling smart light brightness"
```
6. Push to your fork
=> Push your changes to your fork on GitHub:
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature
```
7. Open a Pull Request:  
- Go to the Pull Requests section of the original repository and click New Pull Request.
- Select the branch from your fork and compare it with the master branch of the original repository.
- Provide a detailed description of your changes and submit the pull request.
# Features
- Smart Light: Turn ON/OFF, adjust brightness, and track energy consumption.
- Thermostat: Set and read temperature.
- Security Camera: Monitor motion detection and camera status.
# In the future
=> we plan to add more features, such as:
- Data Logging: Keep track of the historical data for each device.
- User Authentication: Allow different users to control devices with various permission levels.
- Integration with Actual IoT Devices: Eventually, we may extend the project to interface with real-world IoT devices.
